* Intro
This package allows you to browse reddit in org-mode.
* Install
MELPA

[[https://melpa.org/#/reddigg][file:https://melpa.org/packages/reddigg-badge.svg]]

Spacemacs layer:

https://github.com/thanhvg/spacemacs-eos

* Buffers
There are three buffers which are on org-mode. They show links and elisp
commands which will run when you enter/click (~org-open-at-point~) on them. By
default org-mode will ask you for confirmation. You can disable it:

#+begin_example elsip
(setq org-confirm-elisp-link-function nil)
#+end_example

Or change it to ‘y-or-n-p’ if you want to confirm with a single keystroke rather
than having to type "yes".

~*reddigg-main*~: show your subreddit list, enter on them will fetch the
subreddit posts and show them on ~*reddigg*~. On ~*reddigg*~ when you enter on a
post will fetch the comments and show them on ~*reddigg-comments*~ buffer.

* Variables
~reddigg-subs~: list of subreddits you want to show on ~*reddigg-main*~

~reddigg-convert-md-to-org~: control whether to show post/comment
bodies in org-mode markup. (By default they are inserted into the
buffer as they are returned by the Reddit API.)

* Commands
~reddigg-view-main~: show your subreddit list in ~*reddigg-main*~, ~r/all~ and
~r/popular~ are included.

~reddigg-view-sub~: prompt for a subreddits and show it,

~reddigg-view-frontpage~: view frontpage

~reddigg-view-comments~: prompt for a post (eg:
~r/emacs/comments/lfww57/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/~ or
~https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/lfww57/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/~) and
show it.
* Remarks
This mode only lets you view reddit. For a complete interaction with reddit check
