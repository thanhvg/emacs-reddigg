* Intro
This package allows you to browse reddit in org-mode.
* Install
MELPA pending
Spacemacs
* Buffers
There are three buffers which are on org-mode. They show links and elisp
commands which will run when you enter/click (~org-open-at-point~) on them. By
default org-mode will ask you for confirmation. You can disable it:

#+begin_example elsip
(setq org-confirm-elisp-link-function nil)
#+end_example

Or change it to ‘y-or-n-p’ if you want to confirm with a single keystroke rather
than having to type "yes".

~*reddigg-main*~: show your subreddit list, enter on them will fetch the
subreddit posts and show them on ~*reddigg*~. On ~*reddigg*~ when you enter on a
post will fetch the comments and show them on ~*reddigg-comments*~ buffer.
